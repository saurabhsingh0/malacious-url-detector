Dowmload all the files(**icon.png, manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js**) in a folder.

2. Ensure that the **Developer mode** checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked, like this:
3. Click **Load unpacked** to pop up a file-selection dialog & **select your directory**(the folder you downloaded all the files mentioned above).
4. If the extension is valid, it’ll be loaded up and active right away! If it’s invalid, an error message will be displayed at the top of the page. Correct the error, and try again.
5. Ensure that your chrome extension is enabled so you can see it in action.
6. **Enter the url** in the input field and it will predict whether the given url is malicious or not.
